      <div>Of course I know.</div>

      <div class="small dark-2">How much you love me.</div>

      <br />

      <div class="body">
        One time while we were talking you said that you didn't think you gave
        me that many affirmations. I explained that it comes out in all sorts of
        little ways that may not always be direct words. Maybe it's in the way
        that you listen to my shares, or in your mannerisms, or even just the
        tone of your voice as we talked.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But there were other examples I didn't bring up in the moment.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        It's in the way that you light up when I run in the room to do a little
        dance. The acceptance that I feel, healing the parts of me that are
        afraid that acting that way isn't masculine enough to be loved.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        It's in the way that you take a step back in our conflicts. In how you
        try to ask questions to see where I'm coming. In the effort you put in
        to engage despite your strongest feelings to run away.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        It's in this memory I have. When you said that I try to take
        responsibility for finding solutions in conflicts, the same way I've
        played peacemaker in my parents' relationship. You said that I always
        try to be the voice of optimism in my own relationships. You said that
        this time you want to be able to support me back. The depth of
        understanding it takes for you to say these things, and the depth of
        love needed to choose to support me while we were having difficult
        conversation. I was so grateful to be loved by somebody so special, that
        they are able to love so deeply.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So of course I know that you love me. You really are special. Because
        you are capable of such deep love, that I am certain that you love me
        more than any partner has ever loved me, and I am sure that I love you
        more than I've ever loved anybody.
