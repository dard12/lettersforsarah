        You know I love referencing and quoting TV shows. Usually you won't know
        the reference, so you'll sit there while I explain the plotline to an
        episode of Bob's Burgers that I haven't even watched myself, but one
        time I saw a clip of it on youtube and it got stuck in my brain, and
        mid-conversation I decided I want it in your brain too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Well these past few days I've noticed something new. I still love
        references, that hasn't changed. But now I feel like we're building a
        common vocabulary of references as we experience life together, and
        instead of references to TV shows or stories it's references to our
        memories together. Little things like the salty chocolate skull in
        Greece, or the girl that ran up to our table and hugged the cat sitting
        with us in Turkey. More and more often my references aren't references
        to niche shows anymore, but references to memories that only the two of
        us have.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I want you to know that I'm grateful for these memories. My brain
        latched onto those TV show references because so often those shows were
        significant in some way to how I think and how I feel, and our memories
        together occupy the same space in my life now. I'm grateful for you, and
        I love you.
