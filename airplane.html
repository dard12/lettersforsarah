      <div>Thoughts on an airplane</div>

      <div class="body">
        We were about to take off on our trip to Greece. It was sunny out. I
        think. You know my memory isn't all that good. But I remembered that you
        would always message your loved ones before the plane took off. A habit
        you developed to make sure that they knew you loved them, even if you
        didn't land safely.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I thought about that. I wondered what would happen if we knew the plane
        was going down, and that we weren't going to make it. I started
        picturing it. The plane would be shaking horribly. Our seatbelts would
        tighten. The plane would be quiet at first â€” all of us holding our
        breaths together in one extended pause. Then, somebody would cry, ever
        so softly. Or maybe we would start shouting, all at once, as loudly as
        we could as if it would fight off what was happening. But whatever we
        did, we would all eventually understand that nothing we did would change
        our remaining minutes.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        After that happened, I wondered, what would be worth doing? What could I
        even realistically do in the minutes I had left before everything went
        blank forever? You were sitting in the seat in front of me. All I could
        think of was reaching out, holding your hand, and telling you that I
        loved you. Because that was the only thing I cared about, and the only
        thing I found meaningful in that quickly disappearing world. I just
        needed you to know that you are loved, and I hoped that it'd make the
        closing of the curtains on your world a little less frightening.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I thought about that. I thought about how up until that trip, that
        memory on the airplane, I'd never been able to picture something worth
        doing in the moments before a crash. But I've finally found a little
        more meaning in my life in loving you, and I hope you know that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        That's it! This is a tiny affirmation after all. Actually this is
        already longer than I wanted it to be. And you know, originally I was
        going to write something about how while going down in that plane I'd
        finally be able to say I really will love you until the day I die, but I
        decided that'd be a bit too morbid. Maybe that'll make it into a
        different letter some day. You'll just have to keep an eye out for it.

        With love, <br />
