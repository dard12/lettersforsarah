        Happy birthday bud! I wonder how you feel reading that headline right
        now. But let's get into the letter.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        We've been dating for a while now and I think I know you pretty well.
        The way you convert your fear into anger — as if you think that if you
        could just punch the darkness hard enough that it would turn back into
        daylight. The way that when waitstaff clears our table at restaurants
        there's always just a little bit more food on your side of the table
        than mine. The way that when I make my bloop bloop bleep nonsense sounds
        that you so readily accept all the parts that make up me. So for this
        birthday letter I want to do something a little different and present my
        Grand Unified Theory of Sarah And Why She Is Special And Deserves Love

      <div class="body">
        First let's go over a number of facts that I've learnt about you
        throughout our relationship. This is going to feel like a bit of a roast
        but don't worry. I'll tie up all the loose ends by the end.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Fact the first: you constantly read company mission statements. Honestly
        this is so strange to me. Before I met you I truly believed that NOBODY
        read those statements. I was fully convinced that companies put those
        out just for fun, because I couldn't imagine somebody reading them and
        genuinely believing them. And now here I am, dating somebody who not
        only reads them but actively chooses companies based on them. Wild.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Fact the second: you read a sentence printed on a t-shirt like, "if you
        want to fly, give up everything that weights you down", and your first
        thought isn't, "wow what a load of crock can I get this shirt without
        that quote on it". In fact I think you might like the shirt more because
        of that line. Completely unfathomable.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Fact the third: you travel to foreign countries — countries that you
        will eventually leave — and put all your efforts into connecting with
        people you may very well never see again. This is the most telling sign
        of who you are by far, and the one that most confused me when I first
        met you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        My therapist recently asked me what attracted me to you, and I told her
        that I was actually super confused by you when I first met you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        She looked concerned and asked, "but in a good way?".
      </div>

      <div class="body">"Yeah! In a good way."</div>

      <div class="body">
        I was confused by you because you lived life so differently than I did.
        I remember being in Taiwan, asking you why you liked travel so much. You
        said it was the people. I wondered to myself, what is it about meeting
        people that was so special. That it would be worth the effort to meet
        them, knowing you would leave.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Above all, I couldn't understand how you were able to put your
        connections to people at the center of your life. You see, I had spent
        my entire life putting those connections as far away from me as
        possible. Years of being alone, pretending to sleep, and minimizing
        myself had taught me that the most painless existence was one spent as
        far away from the things that could hurt me as possible.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So imagine my confusion when the world plops down this girl in front of
        me, who decided to love people with her whole being despite the near
        certainty that some of those people will leave her. And she does it with
        just the sheer force of will of her own hope and optimism. But recently
        I've realized, that's just it. All these differences between us where I
        see naivety, you see hope.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Your love for company mission statements, for cheesy t-shirt slogans,
        for song lyrics we disagree on, for tiktoks with slowly panning scenery
        and overlaid self-help quotes. And your love for people. They all lead
        back to your ability to hope. I know you've always said that you work
        hard to act with hope and not fear, but I've never known how much you
        embodied this value until I saw it in every aspect of your life.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And I want you to appreciate how amazing this trait of yours is.
        Everytime somebody looks taken aback by the genuineness of your
        interest, it's because we don't usually meet people with the ability to
        hope for connection the way that you can. I imagine all the people you
        meet having the same experience that I did, regarding you with a mix of
        confusion and amazement, that in a world of people too skeptical to hope
        for genuine connection there's this girl running about, full of hope and
        earnest interest, asking people to play this strange new card game she
        found about opening up with your deepest vulnerabilities.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I think you're dying from boredom upstairs as I'm writing this, so I'll
        wrap this up. From the first time I met you, I've known that you lived
        in a very different way than I did. But I also faintly knew that I
        wanted to live the way you did. With hope. We talked before about how in
        a good relationship partners learn from each other, and from the first
        time I met you I've been learning about the hope that pours out from
        every part of who you are. I love you, and I admire you more every day
        that I learn more about you.
