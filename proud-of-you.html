      <div class="body">
        I'm so proud of the person that you are. I hope you know that. You
        always talk about admiring my moral compass, but I don't talk enough
        about how much I admire yours. I've seen you make the hardest choices,
        time and time again, simply because you believe it is the right thing to
        do. You believe this with such strength, that you almost can't imagine
        other people picking any other choice. This has come up so many times
        that it's almost routine for me to say, "Hey! Have more empathy for the
        weak! It's hard to make the right choice every time". You'd be
        indignant, "I am empathetic!". And I'd laugh. Because you are, but
        you've lived life with such a conviction for what is right and wrong,
        that it's just hard for you to relate.

        So over and over again I'll experience this. We'll be watching a show,
        and out of the corner of my eye I'll see you fuming over the choices a
        character makes. And I'll smile to myself, "this is just a part of why I
        love her".

        With so much pride, <br />
