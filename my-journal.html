      <div class="body">
        Look bub! It's a new section of this website. I've been thinking that
        there's lots of things that I want to tell you, but I never feel they're
        fleshed out enough to put in a letter, or they're not romantic enough,
        or meaningful enough. And you'd probably think that you're ok with that,
        but still it's been hard for me to get over that hurdle. So I'm trying
        this as a new way to write things down â€” it'll be a journal from me that
        you can read, kind of like how you always asked to see my notes.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Now that I've gotten the explanation for this page out of the way, I did
        see the notes you shared today. To be very clear, it was very helpful
        and I'm very glad you shared them. But also I woke up, saw it, and
        thought, "I didn't wake up today to get attacked!! Hello!! Hm!!" ðŸ˜¤
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And I know your therapist is right, but parts of me were like I know all
        of that! I don't know if you guys know, but I'm aware!! Hm!! I have this
        on the top of my notes!!
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        my uncertainty this whole time maybe wasn't about sarah as a person, or
        even our relationship, because i know exactly who she is, and i know our
        relationship, my uncertainty stems from my fear of not loving her
        enough. me not making matcha, not feeling more energy to express my love
        more, all of them feeds into being afraid, what if i don't love her
        enough?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        See!! Am not dummy!! But also just so you know I'm not actually mad.
        Just a little huff, but not too seriously.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And to be fair, I recognize that even though I agree that this is likely
        the root issue, I do still feel a need to figure out how much physical
        attraction, or needing medication, or how difficult the past couple
        years were on both of us, affected how I felt. And with me wanting to
        figure all these things out, I recognize the process can take too long.
        I struggle with this thought too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I feel like it's like how when I wanted to know what love was I had to
        read all those books. When I told my friends recently about us, one of
        them â€” you can maybe guess which â€” said he feels like he gets up in the
        morning and he'll choose to play the game of life on medium difficulty,
        but it's almost like I wake up everyday to choose to play on hard
        difficulty. And maybe he's right, but I think sometimes when you're a
        certain kind of person, maybe that's just the kind of life you end up
        with. Of course, I'm thinking about letting go of that need to explore
        all these reasons because I don't want to take too long, but it's been
        hard. I know it must be frustrating to see because progress is so slow,
        but I am trying.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Also on the topic of being slow, I realized there's also probably a
        difference in how long things feel for each of us. I don't know what it
        is, but every partner of mine has said I move slowly, and I've always
        been amazed by how much energy other people have. Even now, two weeks
        after our call, it feels like just yesterday to me, because I've just
        been trying to survive day to day. I do still fully empathize with how
        long things must feel for you, and I know that must be frustrating.
        That's definitely valid, and I'm sorry for that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On the topic of how my friends reacted, I got dinner with the two guys.
        They're of course supportive, and they've both individually texted me to
        check up on me, which has been very sweet. One of them is concerned
        about me making any drastic decisions so I think he wants me to be
        thoughtful before doing anything. The other I think is cautious that any
        door that's open isn't open forever, which is also very fair. I told
        them how proud I was of you for making the choice you did, and both of
        them of course understood where you were coming from. I'm glad to have
        them both.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Less important, but the place we went to get dinner was called Phoenix
        Palace. It's run by the same people as Potluck Club! I think you
        would've liked it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also read the notes you sent about my affirmations for you. Reading
        some of these even I thought, "how was I so sure?!". I realized I've had
        this experience before. My partner will say they stayed because of my
        confidence in working things out, and I'd be surprised that they felt
        that way. I'm not sure why this happens yet, but it does feel related to
        my fears. It feels like I forget my own certainty and it gets painted
        over by my fears, so I end up losing sight of it all. I'll keep thinking
        about it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another thought I had while reading it was, I really was surprised by
        how many affirmations I had given. I hope you won't be offended, but I
        had a moment of huffiness and thought, "Hey! I don't know if I even get
        this many affirmations! I want to be princess too you know! Me
        princess!". But of course that's kind of besides our main point here.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The last thing I want to make sure you know for now is, I really hope
        you know that when you asked that question about choosing between you
        and another person, what I was thinking when I gave my answer. I kept
        trying to say, of course if I'm choosing between the people I'd choose
        us, I love us. But if I chose us right now at this moment, I'm scared
        that I might not be choosing myself. I said the choice would be
        difficult because choosing us right now might mean not exploring all
        these things about myself, and that's difficult for me to let go.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I understand how difficult it was hear that I'd have a hard time
        choosing us, and how hard it must be that I'm not there now, but I
        really need you to know that the difficulty is not because I don't love
        us.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I think that's the major points for now. I hope you're doing OK. I hope
        this was an okay replacement for the letters you were expecting. Letting
        you know all my thoughts while I'm going through this, I thought made
        more sense than writing a conclusion to our story in letters and
        affirmations. Because I don't want to write as if I've stopped trying.
        Because I haven't. I hope by doing this that I don't block your door.
        And if it makes more sense to close the door just let me know, and I'll
        understand. I know that you'll take good care of yourself. I love you.

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub. You BUTT, if you're seeing this you didn't listen to my advice
        and checked the website. I haven't processed everything yet but I
        figured I'd write this just in case you checked. I've spent all day
        today after our call distracting myself. I just didn't feel like I'd be
        able to handle the feelings if I let them well up.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But then, just now, as I finished the game I was using to distract
        myself, I suddenly said out loud, "Is she dead?! No?! Then there's still
        hope". I wrote in my journal, "the fight's not over until she closes the
        door. And I know I'm strong enough to keep fighting". You are my buddy,
        and I love you dearly. We both know you shouldn't wait for me, but if
        it's healthy for you to leave the door just slightly open, I'll fight
        with all the hope I have in me.
