      <div class="small dark-2">All my thoughts recently.</div>

      <br />

      <div class="bold">January 15, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub, I'm sorry that our last call was no fun. I know you called in a
        moment of distress after just recently finding out something very
        difficult. I know it wasn't your fault at all. I know that you were
        looking for comfort and I wasn't able to provide that in the end. I'm
        sorry for that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I hope that you're getting some space and capacity to process
        everything, and that you have more direction now on what you want to do.
        I still fully support you in whatever you choose. I hope that you're
        able to rest.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Even now that was a difficult call for me. I'll go into that a little
        bit but I want you to know that my letters still feel true to me. It's
        natural and normal to feel the feelings you feel, and I accept whatever
        choices you make.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I think a lot of things were difficult for me. Without going into the
        details, I mentioned that the position you're in is something I'm a
        little familiar with now, and it's a very sore spot for me. I also think
        with us not talking for so long, it's just impossible to go into these
        conversations with the same level of understanding as before, which made
        navigating it even worse.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another one of my sore spots I couldn't fully verbalize, until I saw a
        skit the other day and it made me cry. It was a joke, so it feels weird
        to be bringing it up, but I related to it so much I knew the person
        making the joke had at least known some of these same feelings. The
        character had said:
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        My desire for my words to have sterile, clinical, literal meanings, is
        sort of a wall that prevents me from venturing close to people.
        Sometimes I think the most direct route to another's heart is through
        nonsense, and nonsense has always eluded me.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And it made me think about how much I pause to think about my use of
        words. To be accurate as possible, to convey my thoughts as precisely as
        possible, so that I don't cause misunderstandings, so that I can be
        understood by others, so that I don't cause conflicts, so that I can be
        safe. All my life, every word I say, both in the moment I say them and
        in the boundless lengths of time after they've already been spoken, I
        scan constantly for inaccuracy, for threats to my safety.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        In that constant vigilance, where is there room for playfulness? For
        lighthearted pranks? For jokes made without measured deliberation?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        For a long time I knew that was what others liked. I knew that this is
        how you form bonds, through joking, laughing, and teasing. But I wasn't
        capable of it. It broke my heart to know that one of the fundamental
        ways that people created connection was something that felt completely
        out of reach for me. That was my flaw, and the price was that no matter
        how much I wanted to spend my life helping others, I'd never be close to
        them. I'd just build products and services from afar without becoming a
        part of what made people, people. And I was okay with that life.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But over time, I'd come to appreciate the strengths I saw in myself. I'd
        see a character as anxious as me, and see how his anxiety was rooted in
        the kindness he felt for others. I'd see his anxiety be understood by
        the people around him, and his care returned in earnest by friends that
        became as close as family. And I'd think perhaps I could be accepted too
        if that fiction could turn into reality. I'd talk to my therapist, and
        she'd joke, "aren't Sarah and I both people that understand and love
        these traits of yours? So there's at least two of us in this world!",
        and we'd laugh.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But deep down I knew. People everywhere are the same. We love the ease
        of playfulness. The lightheartedness, the joy, the confidence. Even
        those that didn't simply had not experienced it yet. Once they
        experience it surely they would prefer it too. I don't blame them. Of
        course they do. It has happened to me over and over again. It is
        natural.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So when I had heard from you again after all this time, it was
        difficult. And it's not like I'm incapable of a joke, I know. But I do
        think there's a fundamental gravity and weight of responsibility to my
        words and actions that I just don't think I can ever let go of. It
        hurts, but I really am just too serious. I joked to myself that maybe
        I'll try dating again in my 40s. Maybe more people will understand by
        then.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways bub, I've rambled on for so long about myself again. I know
        you're having a hard time, and your recent discovery has made it even
        more difficult. I hope you rest and take good care of yourself. Again, I
        truly believe that whatever choices you make I'll fully support. And
        regardless of the difficulties I had in the moment, I'm sorry I wasn't
        able to be your comfort in the moment you needed it. I do think that
        maybe I'll dial back the frequency of these letters a bit because I'm
        unsure if it's healthy for us, but I'll still write them sometimes. I
        just realized I haven't even responded to your last letter, since
        talking about our call took up the full letter this time. But I do still
        love and care for you, and all my letters still feel true. I love you
        lots.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        PS. Turns out the third round of antibiotics has failed again. Another
        set of tests, another while of restrictive eating. The journey
        continues, but that's okay.

      <div class="body">
        (update) Oh my gosh I forgot to update the last update date so you might
        not have seen it! It's updated now.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! This is a really quick note to say merry christmas!! I was
        really glad to see your message the other day. Don't worry at all. Like
        I've said I'm totally in support of waiting until you have time again. I
        hope you're doing well.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On a separate note I've finally got a diagnosis for a different cause
        for my acid! So I'm on my third round of antibiotics now. It's a
        different issue so a different antibiotic than the other two times, and
        it gives me less nausea so I'm thankful for that. I'd been having a lot
        of issues so I put together a bunch of notes for the doctor to convince
        him to test for this new thing. Turns out, once I was done explaining
        myself he was already so convinced he diagnosed me on the spot and
        started my treatment! So anyways I have some hope that it'll finally get
        better, and if we're right everything should be OK. Nothing's guaranteed
        but I'm hoping I can finally eat again in a couple months.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I hope you're doing well bub. If you ever need support you know
        that I'm here for you. I hope you have lots of happiness and a very
        merry christmas. I love you lots.

      <div class="body">
        Oh my gosh hi bub! I meant to upload a letter at midnight but I realized
        there's no freaking daylight savings over there! In any case happy
        birthday! I'm going to update this letter later to add some more
        thoughts but I hope you have a joy filled birthday bub. Love you lots.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        P.S. this isn't like that video you showed me!!! It's an honest
        miscalculation!! 😤😤
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        (Update. Also I changed the date to the 18th for your timezone.)
      </div>
      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! So for your birthday this year I wanted to talk a little about a
        thought I had recently. I wrote in my journal, "maybe the relationship
        I'm looking for, rather than attraction, is full of awe. Where both
        sides look at the other in wonder, how such an incredible person exists.
        In such a relationship, it's natural to treat one another with
        incredible love and care. To be many years down the road, and still be
        as fallen in love as ever."
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I thought about this because I've been looking at the people around me.
        And they're all good people, but in some ways people still let me down.
        I've experienced a few times now this same kind of disappointment. I
        grieve when I see others stumble. And I don't mean that I expect others
        to never make mistakes, or to never be weak. I'm the first to admit when
        I don't have the strength to push forward, and making the right call
        every time is an impossibility. And to be clear, nothing too big has
        happened so you don't have to worry. But still, it upsets me.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And then I realized how differently I see you. I have such confidence in
        you. And again it's not about not making mistakes. It's about how much I
        can trust you to give it your all to do the right thing. That if you
        fell down, I know with absolute certainty that you went down while still
        kicking at the dark. I know you'd feel as scared as any of us would
        feel, but you wouldn't use that as an excuse to live life differently
        from what your values say. It inspires me. It makes me want to be ever
        more like you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But then I thought about how the last couple years we were together, you
        really were strained to your limits. I realized with the amount of
        support you needed, and the amount of space I lost for myself, I think I
        lost sight a little bit of the awe that I saw you with. I'm sorry bub.
        It even sounds stupid to me. To lose sight of something so important so
        easily. I should've looked harder. Remembered better. Years ago, when
        you were worried that if you changed parts of you that I loved that I'd
        stop loving you, I'd told you that I'd simply look for new reasons to
        love you. I didn't stop loving you, but I still should've looked harder.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Because these days, I realize I do see you with that awe and wonderment.
        I know things are hard for you right now, but you're every bit as I
        remembered.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I know in your progress report you talked about needing to break free
        from the scarcity and self blaming patterns you have with relationships.
        I hope that you can see yourself with the same awe that I see you with.
        I hope that you can internalize that I see you that way because you are
        incredible. I hope that you appreciate your own strengths, without
        downplaying them by saying it's simply what you should do. Because the
        reality is that most people don't do what they should do. I cannot think
        of a single thing you've done that would make me question your
        character. I cannot be more proud of you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        All that said, I still stand by what we said in our call. I wanted to
        see if it made sense to talk, but it can never come at the cost of
        dimming your own light. If the relationship I'm looking for is one where
        I look at my partner in awe and wonderment, I need to give you space to
        be the version of yourself that you're most proud of. Just know that if
        it ever makes sense again, I'd like us to get to know each other again.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        In the meantime, I hope you are doing okay bub! Know that I'm always
        here if you need support. I hope you get the rest, space, and joy that
        you deserve. Happy birthday bub. I love you very much.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">October 27, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Gosh it's been a while since my last letter. I really should
        have written one sooner. I wanted to go through all my notes in the last
        few years to process and organize them first before I wrote this letter,
        but earlier today I realized I'm being dumb and I should just write the
        letter first. I'll talk a little more about that later, but first let me
        tell you my thoughts about your letter!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I really, really, loved your "reminders" letter. I think I might've
        written this before, but that's my favorite letter you've written me. It
        just makes me so gratefull and so happy. I'm so grateful that my love
        can support you even when we're so far apart. I'm so glad that it has
        such a positive role to play. I've talked recently about my struggle
        with remembering the love that I give out. To see you feel its effects,
        to be reminded so clearly that you see it beside you, fills me with an
        amount of gratitude that I honestly had difficulty processing.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I know how much you value your freedom, so knowing that this love can
        provide safety while you explore makes me want to cry. Because I feel so
        deeply that you deserve everything you are looking for, and to be able
        to support that happiness makes me more grateful than I could handle. It
        really made this letter a little hard to start writing. But know that
        this letter taking longer wasn't because I forgot. I just needed time to
        process the gratitude I felt.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On that topic I've been trying to be better at recognizing the love that
        I give out. I've told multiple friends recently about my struggle with
        this, and I've been grateful that each time they've responded with some
        version of, "you're being crazy! It's so clear that you give out love!".
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I even thought about how a few years back while we were traveling, I had
        sublet my room out to a college junior of mine. I had been the "mom" of
        a bunch of these juniors, and she had told me that her impression of me
        was just that I kept running around trying to make sure everybody felt
        comfortable. I didn't even remember that! I had no idea that's how I had
        come off. But I thought about that recently and chuckled to myself, in
        the same way that I always laughed at how consistent you are, I couldn't
        believe that I was so consistent in wanting to provide care and safety.
        I was just not able to recognize it in myself then, but I'm trying to do
        it now.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So to get back to the earlier topic. I wanted to go through my notes
        because I've been feeling better about my ability to love, so I feel
        like I'm making real progress, but I still wanted to categorize and
        organize and see all my notes in front of me. Because recently I've been
        thinking about if it would make sense to do a call again, to check in,
        and to see where we're both at. I don't think I have everything figured
        out, but maybe it could still makes sense to start talking.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        It's been so long, and I feel like you must have had so many experiences
        and thoughts since we last talked directly. Even though I feel like I
        still know you, there must also be parts of you that are different now.
        And I wonder if it'd make sense to for me to start getting to know the
        person you are now. Of course if talking doesn't make sense right now
        just let me know and of course I'll understand. I know you have made
        lots of progress and still have much more to make, and I would never
        want to jeopardize that in any way. Allowing you to have the space for
        that I would prioritize above all else. But in either case, I hope you
        are doing well bub. I love you very much.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">October 9, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Turns out this didn't take too long to write, just a couple
        days! Anyways, I'm going to try to respond to everything in your notes.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        When I first opened your letter I was scared. And then I was relieved.
        When you said you had asked chatGPT about where you're most likely to
        find an ideal partner I had the biggest laugh in a while, and then I
        yelled, "you crazy person! Who does that??". I told my therapist about
        that and she laughed too. She said from her experience Singaporean guys
        have a lot of red flags, so I told her I'd let you know.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I really liked this letter. You've said something similar to this before
        on our call, but I thought about how incredible it is that I still felt
        aligned with you. It's been a long time, and we haven't spoken directly,
        and I don't want to make assumptions, but it does still feel like we
        have similar goals, values, and journeys even now. I kept thinking that
        as I read on. The similarity in learning that you sometimes feel unsafe,
        in you grieving lost connection, in putting in the effort to move
        forward healthily despite it all.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I thought about that recently. That this determination to be good, to
        ourselves, to others, and to prioritize being healthy and having a clear
        sense of right and wrong, is so important to me. I wonder if you would
        read this and think, "doesn't everybody do that?". But they don't. I've
        seen people make less healthy choices, in moments of weakness, in
        moments of difficulty, and it's disappointed me every time. It makes me
        think about when I told you about how much I trust you. I don't need
        people to make the right choices every time, but I need to know they
        truly tried, and I know I can always trust you to do that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I read on. When I got to the notes about scarcity I thought,
        "god I love her". Because sometimes I think I feel the same way. I think
        that you feel it more intensely than I do, but the need to unlearn
        scarcity and make ourselves feel safe again applies to me too. Seeing
        you learn about these things helped me think about them too. That
        remains such a special part of our connection, and I love it so dearly.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        When I read the part where you realized you were doing all the heavy
        lifting of making connections feel close, I agreed so much! I'm glad
        that you're finally able to give yourself more credit for how special
        you really are. I remembered how when we first met you had prodded me
        with all these questions until I opened up. I had always prided myself
        on being able to understand others, but you brought a whole other
        version of that into my world. My version was reactive, I wanted to be
        able to understand others in conflicts. Yours was proactive, you pushed
        to connect even when you were just passing by their life. And I loved
        it. I really need to reiterate — I love who I am now, and a large part
        of that is because I reflect the parts that I love in you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I read on. I did get scared when you talked about safety and attention
        not being consistent. I hoped that it wasn't about us, but I did accept
        that could be the case. At the least it was understandable for the last
        couple of years. But I am glad in the places where you'd clarify
        something was about your first ex instead. I kept reading and saying,
        "oh no!!", and then I'd see the clarification and think "phew". There
        was also a part where I wrote down "am I trash??". But I hope not.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        When I got to the part of you filling out post-date worksheets, I
        laughed again and thought, "I love that she's as crazy as me". The clear
        effort and earnestness with which you're trying to be more healthy. I
        just love it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also think that it's really good that you can recognize now that you
        don't suck at dating. Or at least that it's natural and reasonable for
        you to respond the way you do in dating, and that there's a way forward
        to respond differently. I'm really proud of you. I hope you know that.

        But also unrelated were these later parts generated by chatGPT?? I was a
        little huffy, I know it's pretty good but also what the heck 😤😤. I
        guess I accept. Also unrelated but one of my friends saw your IG post
        and asked in a concerned way if I felt ok, because you had written about
        people not wanting to be in your life. He asked me, "that's definitely
        about you right?". I had to think about it and then I said, "oh god I
        think I repressed that memory". Because I realized I had seen it, gotten
        scared, and promptly removed it from my mind! But I do think it's a very
        good message, especially with the context I have now of all the work
        you're doing.

      <div class="body">
        I'm going to write a separate letter for the other letters you shared
        with me another time. I wrote this letter until I went to bed yesterday!
        But I love you dearly bub, and I'm so, so proud of the work you're doing
        and the progress you're making. I love you very much.

        Hi bub! This is the quickest note to say that I read your letters and I
        loved them so, so much, but it's going to take me maybe a few days to
        write a full letter back. I think the one you just shared might be my
        favorite letter ever, and I'm so incredibly proud of you for all the
        progress you're making. I want to go into it more in a longer letter,
        but I love you so very much!

      <div class="body">
        (update) Ohh ok 😭😭😭 I accept, I appreciate and thanks bub.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub. I'm a little sad today but I know it'll be ok. I saw your
        stories so I know you're doing ok and that makes me feel better. I
        wanted to let you know the health scare from last time is probably going
        to be fine. The doctor wasn't too worried, but I'll get a second opinion
        another time just in case.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also wanted to say that I didn't feel good about the last letter. I
        hope that it doesn't feel like I'm constantly just chasing after new
        hope in a way that never pans out. I hope it's not fatiguing or
        frustrating to see me talk about them. But I really do feel that there
        has been progress, I just don't know how to properly convey it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I went to our notion pages today, and when I saw that link to the page
        named "Farewell", I nearly had a heart attack! I thought that was a new
        hidden letter! But I saw it was from before. I re-read your thoughts
        from the break up and experienced all those thoughts all over again. I
        understand. I'm sad, but I still love you very much, and I'm going to
        keep going until I can get to the other side.

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Gosh it's been a while. I'm a bit anxious right now but I wanted
        to write about the progress I talked about last time so that you're kept
        up-to-date. But I'm anxious right now because I'm having a small health
        scare. It's probably nothing, I haven't gone to the doctor yet but I'm
        calling them on Monday and I might just be overthinking things right
        now. Of course if I find out anything I'll let you know. I'll be ok!!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways back to the progress. Recently I was talking to my therapist and
        I said that when I read what you wrote about gratitude, I started
        feeling scared. Because in reading about all the gratitude you felt for
        our relationship, I started feeling scared about whether I felt the
        same. In the moment I tried to push away the thought to focus on your
        letter instead, but I felt something was wrong.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The thing is when I brought this up in therapy, I caught myself. I went
        quiet, and after a while loudly said, "oh my god, I'm doing the thing!".
        My therapist kind of just waited for me to explain, and I said I
        realized I'm doubting my gratitude the same way I doubted my love. But
        if I spent even just a little time thinking about it, I knew that of
        course I'm grateful.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm so grateful for everything that you are. Recently I saw somebody say
        that you cannot have difficult conversations with people that do not
        have the emotional maturity for it. It made me think about how rare and
        special a relationship we had to be able to tackle every difficult
        conversation as well as we did. It made me understand more deeply how
        truly kind you are, to be able to react so consistently to difficult
        situations with softness and a willingness to understand.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But I'm getting away from my main point. The point is I read about your
        gratitude and immediately went to a place of questioning my own
        gratitude. I think about your love and I started questioning my own
        love. But it didn't make sense. I did feel grateful, I did feel love, I
        just couldn't stop myself from feeling scared that I didn't.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So I thought, right, these fears really do come from irrational places.
        And it hit me. This is just like my people pleasing journey. I'm afraid
        of things that weren't really happening, ghosts that weren't really
        there, and the smallest things could trigger these fears. But that meant
        that the framework I had for changing my people pleasing could help this
        time too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        First I had to understand the core irrational belief. With people
        pleasing I believed that I wasn't likable. With my fears now I'm afraid
        that I don't love enough and feel certain enough with my love.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Then I had to internalize that those beliefs were disconnected from
        reality. I had to make myself feel safe and reassured that it wasn't
        true. For people pleasing I had that pin board where I reminded myself
        of all the reasons I was likable. For my fears now, I hadn't done the
        work yet to make myself feel safe! That's why even though I had written
        that I knew your therapist was right, when I read your letter my fears
        still sparked.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        This made so many of my experiences make sense. The way that I almost
        couldn't believe how many affirmations I gave you over the years until
        you shared your notes with me. The way that you'd point out all the ways
        in which I love you, and how could I still not feel certain! The way
        that I feel better when I write you these letters.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        In the same way that I needed reminders that I'm likable, I need
        reminders that I'm capable of love too. As it turns out, even though I
        had made this website to remind you of my love for you, I needed it just
        as much to remind myself of my own love.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways, that's where I am at now. I'm going to try to be more conscious
        of my own love and certainty. I'm going to write to myself to remind
        myself that I do feel these feelings, and that I don't have to doubt
        them. I'm feeling hopeful that with enough reminders, I'll be able to
        hear my own voice again and trust in what it has to say. I hope you're
        doing well, bub, and I'm going to try my hardest. I love you very much.

      <div class="bold">August 30, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Oh my gosh I loved your last letter. You know when I got it I
        had to first scroll to the bottom just to check if it was about to be a
        good or bad letter. And then could you believe I scrolled back up just
        to find out you were out there chasing sheep!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I laughed so hard and messaged basically all my friends about it. I've
        been so stressed recently, and part of it is because I know how long I'm
        taking. I want to move faster, but it's taking time, and I'm pushing
        myself, but it's not as fast as I'd like. And in the midst of all this
        anxiety, I get a video of you chasing sheep!! It was the laugh I needed.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I wish you could've heard how vocal I was reading your letter. The loud
        "mmMMMMMmmmm" sound I made when you changed your perspective from having
        to do things to wanting to do them. Or when you said I wouldn't have
        scheduled so many apartment viewings and I yelled, "I could've done it
        too!!".
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm so proud of you for signing a lease!! That's huge! I've always
        wanted you to have a space for yourself, and I'm so glad that you
        finally have it. I laughed a little at you only looking at 7 apartments,
        but I know it's hard to let go of that perfectionism.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Do you remember how I spiraled too when I first moved into my current
        apartment? I remember calling you on the phone, and you encouraging me,
        reassuring me that I'll be able to make the place my own. I remember how
        hard it was to get out of that spiral, and I'm proud of you for being
        able to support yourself through that. And of course, I smiled when you
        got that lamp. When you finished making your space and said you were
        happy, it made me so happy too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also loved your realization about gratitude. A long time ago when I
        didn't understand happiness, that was one of the recurring topics I
        would read about. People would say that feeling grateful was tied
        closely to the kind of happiness that fulfills you long term, the kind
        that we should all be looking for. I forget about that sometimes, but
        it's funny how you've once again ended up with the same answer with your
        intuition again.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also wrote in my notes, "I love that in her gratefulness in seeing the
        beauty around her, she just wants to bring the people she cares about
        there too". It really is just another reason I love the way you are.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        By the way, I don't know if you noticed but when I first opened the
        document you were still editing it! I saw you were in it and I was like,
        "Ahh!! We're not supposed to talk!! Rules!!", so I closed the tab and
        distracted myself instead. I did think about it afterwards and realized,
        oh there aren't any rules against that. But I hope you know I wasn't
        avoiding you for negative reasons, y'know!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I miss you too bub. I have lots that I want to talk about still but I
        wanted to write this letter first to respond to your journal. The
        stressful stuff I don't know if it makes sense to talk about yet, but
        just know that I'm still trying and I think I'm making real progress.
        I'll try to write about the progress next entry soon!! I love you lots,
        bub, and I'm proud of the ways you're growing even now.

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub, jeez it's been a while again. Life has been so stressful, but
        I'm managing the best that I can. I just didn't want you to think that
        I'd forgotten, because I haven't.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I still think about you. The other day I bought a milk frother to heat
        up my milk, and guess what! I found out I could put milk, water, and
        matcha powder all in the machine and it makes the most perfect cup of
        matcha every time. A part of me smiled and thought, if only I had bought
        this sooner.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another day I found out that a Hong Kong cafe restaurant opened within
        delivery distance. They even had macaroni soup and milk tea. I tried it
        and as far as I could tell it tasted good. But it made me sad, so I
        probably won't order it often. I wondered if you would've approved of
        their taste.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I trust and know that you're taking good care of yourself. Recently I
        wrote in my journal that I was so upset at myself. I had burned myself
        out and left no space for me. Even now, I'm scrambling a bit. But I'm
        going to do my best, recover, and forge ahead. I love you dearly, bub.

      <div class="body">
        Hi again bub, it's been a while huh! I haven't made much progress
        because life has been such a drain lately, and I'm tired a lot. Maybe
        one day we'll get to talk about it in detail. But for now I wanted to
        write a short entry so you know I haven't forgotten!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did end up figuring out a good set of core values, and I feel pretty
        good about them as a reflection of me. Figuring out what a day in my
        ideal life looked like was also nice. In a lot of ways it was
        encouraging to see that a day like that felt very possible with the life
        we had together.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The ideal relationship part gave me a bit more trouble. I think the
        ideal day gave a lot of clues at what the ideal relationship would look
        like, but there are just a few more things that I still haven't figured
        out, but I'll keep trying my best.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Other than that, I went to visit my brother again to help with their
        furniture. I gave them all the updates, and at one point they turned to
        my niece and asked her what she thought I should do. It was almost like
        fortune telling, since we're not sure she really even understands what
        she's being asked about. But, she did think I should get on the plane.
        So at least I have her approval.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I've also been thinking about the notes you shared, where you said that
        you didn't feel like dating me or anybody else right now. I think about
        that pretty often these days. I really do hope that you are recovering
        from your burnout slowly. I love you very much, I hope you're taking
        good care of yourself, and I hope that tiredness would hang onto you
        just a little less.
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="bold">July 14, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Ok so I read your new therapy notes and have lots of thoughts,
        but I'm going to start writing from before I read that ok!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        First thing's first, my test came back negative so they didn't find the
        bacteria! But it's been wrong before and I'm still getting lots of acid,
        so I'm going to wait another few months to see what happens. Not the
        best, but not the worst!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The next thing is that my friend made me watch a show called Orb. I
        loved it so much that I wanted to say I hope you don't watch it. If we
        somehow make it to the other side of this in the future, maybe we could
        watch it together.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The show came exactly when I needed it. The story had a lot to do with
        the convictions of people. So even when the characters were afraid, even
        when they couldn't possibly know the future, they could find the courage
        to move forward because of their conviction.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And it hit me. Certainty is knowing, but conviction is believing. Each
        of those people moved with such purpose. But it wasn't because they knew
        with certainty what would happen, it was because they had strong beliefs
        and values, and that made them firm in their choices.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I was visiting my brother recently and I was telling him about our break
        up. We went back and forth a bunch, and I told him about my fears. He
        started saying something like, "but you're not being rational! Those
        fears have nothing to do with what choice you should make". I got all
        huffy, like, "ugh!! You're just like Sarah! You're following this
        straight line from intuition or logic to a conclusion, but you're not
        understanding the feelings of the weak! The fear that makes decisions
        difficult!".
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And a second realization hit me. The way he lives, the way you live, the
        way all those characters I love and admire live, are all the same. When
        you have a strong sense of values and beliefs, all decisions boil down
        to "does this align with my values and beliefs". If it does you do it,
        and if it doesn't you don't. As afraid as you get, as difficult as
        things are, it all comes back to alignment, and that cuts through all
        the complexities of fears and anticipations of what might happen.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I told my brother I think that's what's different about me. I can't
        trust my gut or my intuition. I'm critical of everything, even myself,
        and I'm anxious about everything. But looking at you guys, with your
        strong sense of internal values, it's almost like you have a torch
        lighting your way while I'm grasping in the dark.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So I'm working on defining my core values, ideal life, and ideal
        relationship like you talked about before. I think if I can define them
        in a way that I know is true to me, I'll have something to believe in,
        and I hope that'll give me the clarity I need to make the choices that
        are right for me. I don't know yet if this will work out, but I hope so.
      </div>

      <div class="body">---</div>

      <div class="body">
        Now on to your therapy notes. I got huffy reading your therapist's
        words! Humph!! I mean of course she's right, but again I feel like it's
        delayed compared to my current situation. I'm not only doing external
        experiments anymore y'know!! But of course it's fair that she doesn't
        know that. And I do still think physical attraction can still be real
        thing, which she might disagree with, but I'm struggling through that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did also notice from the previous notes that she sounded frustrated.
        Just the way that she talks about how the experiments might never end. I
        thought that I understood where she was coming from, but I didn't fully
        realize until this time why she might be this frustrated.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm sad to admit that I didn't see earlier how unhealthy this was for
        you, and I'm sorry I put you through that bub. It hurt to see her talk
        about how unhealthy it got, but I know it must be true.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Of course I knew it on some level beforehand, but I think because we
        weren't talking face-to-face, I didn't know it as deeply as I would've
        if you were next to me. When you compared it to the exhaustion you felt
        from your last job, it clicked into place for me just how tired you must
        be. I could feel how you were back then, and I could only imagine how
        you must feel now.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I don't know what's best here. Have you guys talked about what would
        help you recover most? Do these entries get in the way? I can't tell. I
        was happy when I saw that you had been reading these, but I was also
        scared that it wouldn't be healthy. Because if your recovery comes from
        prioritizing yourself, do these get in the way of that? I don't know.
        I'll keep writing these when I have more thoughts, so you'll have the
        option to read them, but I hope you guys talk about what's best for you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On a lighter note, humph!!! I can't really remember because I have bad
        memory, but I could've sworn I suggested you try doing things without
        research to exposure therapy yourself!!! Maybe!! I might've said that I
        think!! Hmmmmph! But I know, we can only receive these things when we
        are ready for them yada yada. I accept this.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And about those game screenshots. Gosh. I showed my therapist the
        section that you guys said I should share, but I had to clarify that it
        sounds so CHEESY I can barely stomach having written it. She asked,
        "well what's wrong with it?", and I said, "it makes me sound like a
        toxic person!! Like somebody saying ooh woe is me I didn't get enough
        love now I'm sooo broken". Humph!! I never said those things I don't
        know what you mean. 😤 But of course my therapist validated that it's my
        truth so it's fine. And of course I'm not using it as an excuse without
        working on it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I think this is getting a bit too long. As always, I love you
        very much. I hope you get to recover at your own pace. I hope your
        family, friends, and your travels, lighten the load of your exhaustion
        even a little. I hope life is kind to you. I hope you prioritize
        yourself. I'll work hard on finding my own version of the torch in the
        dark, so I can live with the courage and conviction that you live your
        life with. I love and admire you.

        Hi bub, I wanted to write a super short entry just because I didn't want
        the most recent entry to be so gloomy. I haven't gotten the results of
        my acid test back yet, but I'm doing okay and I should get them
        tomorrow.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I've been working through a lot of thoughts, but I haven't figured them
        all out yet. I just wanted you to know that I'm okay, and that I'm still
        trying my best. I also want to write another longer entry soon because
        today is the day we originally scheduled our call for, but I'm still in
        the middle of all my thoughts.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But as always, I hope you're doing well and taking care of yourself, and
        I love you very much.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">July 1, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        I really hope you've read some of these by now, because I can't keep
        starting every entry by telling you to scroll to the bottom, but then I
        thought I can put it at the top of the page! So that's that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Sadly I haven't made too much more progress since last time. Life's been
        no fun! My acid's been coming back, so I went to get tested today. A
        third round of antibiotics is going to be no good. Plus I've been
        battling my laundry. It's been a few days of going back and forth, but I
        gave up today and rebought almost my entire closet of daily clothes
        because they all got messed up. It's a slight silver lining that all my
        basics are from one store. And I think with acid hurting me for more
        than a year now, I think it's changed how I see food. Just no fun at
        all.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did have my therapy session, and I'm going to have another one soon to
        try to talk through everything. I told her about how not feeling energy
        in my relationships maybe triggered my fears about certainty. She asked
        me what I'm afraid of happening if I didn't feel that energy. And I knew
        this answer before, but I think I was more aware this time, that I'm
        afraid of my relationship becoming like my parent's.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I know that we've put in so much effort already to make our relationship
        as healthy as we can. At times it feels clear that we won't turn out the
        same way. But another voice in me also says, it's not like my parents
        got into their marriage thinking they'll end up this way — am I so
        arrogant that I think it can't happen to me?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        She also said that sometimes these core beliefs, like mine about ending
        up like my parents, can act like magnets. Every other issue that comes
        up gets pulled in. Every matcha not made, every concern that I have,
        becomes a reason that the core fear might be true.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        These all seem true, but I haven't figured out what to do about it yet.
        I also haven't gotten much further in the book. I've been fighting on
        all fronts just to keep up with life. One of my friends is going through
        a hard time, but they're going to be okay. I'm just a bit tired. But I
        want you to know that I love you very much, and that hasn't changed. If
        my entries come a little slower, it might be the antibiotics. But I will
        keep trying my best. I love you bub. I hope you're doing well.

      <div class="bold">June 24, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Ok so first of all, I still don't know if you'll have seen the previous
        entries so scroll to the bottom if you haven't already, that'll be the
        first entry! Second of all, this beginning part is not really what this
        journal was supposed to be for but I'm writing it anyways.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm feeling so much anxiety!! For a few days now I've felt like my water
        tasted funny, and today I convined myself that it's not just in my head
        so I took apart my filter trying to figure it out. Then I thought my
        filter just needs replacing. But when I went to water my plants in my
        bathtub the water came out brown!! Brown!!! Gross!!!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Then I went outside and there's freaking smoke coming out of the sewers
        on my block. Steam is normal, but the whole block smells like smoke! How
        long has it been doing that! I don't know I don't go outside!! Ugh!! Is
        that why my water's brown!!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I came home after doing a bunch of research on what water to buy and now
        I'm sitting down but I keep saying to myself, "I'm freaking out here!!
        I'm freaking out!!"
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And geez. I just miss my buddy. It's not a big deal, I have water now.
        Maybe I've been poisoning myself but I'm not gonna die. I know that. I
        just miss the support.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Now onto the actual reason I wanted to write this journal. I started
        reading that book you recommended. I considered jumping straight to
        chapter 13, but I figured it would be helpful to read the whole thing so
        that's what I'm doing.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        While reading the book I thought, "oh, maybe Sarah's thought a lot more
        about this breakup than I have". Not because I haven't thought about it
        — I think about it a lot — but I mean that I've been so focused on
        figuring out my own questions, that I don't know if I fully understood
        how you must have felt trying to figure out if you wanted to break up. I
        realized that must have been very painful to go through on your own. I'm
        sorry you had to go through that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also realized that I've been writing these journals from such a place
        of hope, and in reading this book I wonder if your state of mind has
        been very different. I hope these entries haven't been tone-deaf, and if
        they have I hope that you forgive me.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I don't want my holding onto hope to hold you back from moving on. I can
        only write from where I am at right now. I hope you understand.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways the book has been interesting. I plan on reading a little every
        day. Some parts scare me, but some parts make me feel better. I did get
        a good laugh out of when she mentioned a client tried to assign a
        numerical score to each trait so he could add it all up. Sounds like
        someone we know.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'll keep writing these as I figure more out. And know that I'm hoping
        for the best for you, whatever shape that ends up taking. I love you
        very much, bub.

      <div class="bold">June 22, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hey bub! Wait, first of all I don't know how often you're checking this,
        so if you haven't seen this before you should scroll to the bottom and
        start from there, because the most recent entries are on top. Anyways,
        another day another entry, wow!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I thought you should know some recent thoughts I've been
        exploring. I wrote this in my journal.
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        I'm increasingly thinking maybe all my fears about certainty come from
        this kind of helplessness towards the external circumstance of the
        world. Things about my partner or what might happen. I'm giving away
        power. In the view of my confidence in my own power, maybe I'm capable
        of making it work.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I haven't processed it fully yet, but I think the overall idea is that
        maybe I've been living with a kind of learned helplessness in seeing my
        parents fail their marriage, and I'm just barely smart enough to
        recognize the impossibility of certainty, but not smart enough to
        realize that by focusing on these fears I'm giving up my own power to
        direct my life. That maybe I can't fully control my life, but I'm
        discounting how much power I do have to simply choose a path and put in
        effort to make it work.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Like I said, I don't fully know what this means to me yet, but I do feel
        like there's something about thinking this way that makes me less
        scared. Something that allows me to put trust back in myself, instead of
        being scared of being at the mercy of an impossible-to-know future.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I haven't had therapy to process these thoughts yet, but I'll try to
        keep at it. I hope you're doing OK. I also realized recently I don't
        even know how long you're planning on traveling so I have no clue if
        flying out would make sense. But I guess we'll cross that bridge if we
        get there? Anyways, as always, I love you very much and hope that you're
        exploring all the happinesses of traveling that you had planned to.

      <div class="bold">June 16, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Look bub! It's a new section of this website. I've been thinking that
        there's lots of things that I want to tell you, but I never feel they're
        fleshed out enough to put in a letter, or they're not romantic enough,
        or meaningful enough. And you'd probably think that you're ok with that,
        but still it's been hard for me to get over that hurdle. So I'm trying
        this as a new way to write things down — it'll be a journal from me that
        you can read, kind of like how you always asked to see my notes.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Now that I've gotten the explanation for this page out of the way, I did
        see the notes you shared today. To be very clear, it was very helpful
        and I'm very glad you shared them. But also I woke up, saw it, and
        thought, "I didn't wake up today to get attacked!! Hello!! Hm!!" 😤
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And I know your therapist is right, but parts of me were like I know all
        of that! I don't know if you guys know, but I'm aware!! Hm!! I have this
        on the top of my notes!!
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        my uncertainty this whole time maybe wasn't about sarah as a person, or
        even our relationship, because i know exactly who she is, and i know our
        relationship, my uncertainty stems from my fear of not loving her
        enough. me not making matcha, not feeling more energy to express my love
        more, all of them feeds into being afraid, what if i don't love her
        enough?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        See!! Am not dummy!! But also just so you know I'm not actually mad.
        Just a little huff, but not too seriously.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And to be fair, I recognize that even though I agree that this is likely
        the root issue, I do still feel a need to figure out how much physical
        attraction, or needing medication, or how difficult the past couple
        years were on both of us, affected how I felt. And with me wanting to
        figure all these things out, I recognize the process can take too long.
        I struggle with this thought too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I feel like it's like how when I wanted to know what love was I had to
        read all those books. When I told my friends recently about us, one of
        them — you can maybe guess which — said he feels like he gets up in the
        morning and he'll choose to play the game of life on medium difficulty,
        but it's almost like I wake up everyday to choose to play on hard
        difficulty. And maybe he's right, but I think sometimes when you're a
        certain kind of person, maybe that's just the kind of life you end up
        with. Of course, I'm thinking about letting go of that need to explore
        all these reasons because I don't want to take too long, but it's been
        hard. I know it must be frustrating to see because progress is so slow,
        but I am trying.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Also on the topic of being slow, I realized there's also probably a
        difference in how long things feel for each of us. I don't know what it
        is, but every partner of mine has said I move slowly, and I've always
        been amazed by how much energy other people have. Even now, two weeks
        after our call, it feels like just yesterday to me, because I've just
        been trying to survive day to day. I do still fully empathize with how
        long things must feel for you, and I know that must be frustrating.
        That's definitely valid, and I'm sorry for that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On the topic of how my friends reacted, I got dinner with the two guys.
        They're of course supportive, and they've both individually texted me to
        check up on me, which has been very sweet. One of them is concerned
        about me making any drastic decisions so I think he wants me to be
        thoughtful before doing anything. The other I think is cautious that any
        door that's open isn't open forever, which is also very fair. I told
        them how proud I was of you for making the choice you did, and both of
        them of course understood where you were coming from. I'm glad to have
        them both.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Less important, but the place we went to get dinner was called Phoenix
        Palace. It's run by the same people as Potluck Club! I think you
        would've liked it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also read the notes you sent about my affirmations for you. Reading
        some of these even I thought, "how was I so sure?!". I realized I've had
        this experience before. My partner will say they stayed because of my
        confidence in working things out, and I'd be surprised that they felt
        that way. I'm not sure why this happens yet, but it does feel related to
        my fears. It feels like I forget my own certainty and it gets painted
        over by my fears, so I end up losing sight of it all. I'll keep thinking
        about it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another thought I had while reading it was, I really was surprised by
        how many affirmations I had given. I hope you won't be offended, but I
        had a moment of huffiness and thought, "Hey! I don't know if I even get
        this many affirmations! I want to be princess too you know! Me
        princess!". But of course that's kind of besides our main point here.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The last thing I want to make sure you know for now is, I really hope
        you know that when you asked that question about choosing between you
        and another person, what I was thinking when I gave my answer. I kept
        trying to say, of course if I'm choosing between the people I'd choose
        us, I love us. But if I chose us right now at this moment, I'm scared
        that I might not be choosing myself. I said the choice would be
        difficult because choosing us right now might mean not exploring all
        these things about myself, and that's difficult for me to let go.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I understand how difficult it was hear that I'd have a hard time
        choosing us, and how hard it must be that I'm not there now, but I
        really need you to know that the difficulty is not because I don't love
        us.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I think that's the major points for now. I hope you're doing OK. I hope
        this was an okay replacement for the letters you were expecting. Letting
        you know all my thoughts while I'm going through this, I thought made
        more sense than writing a conclusion to our story in letters and
        affirmations. Because I don't want to write as if I've stopped trying.
        Because I haven't. I hope by doing this that I don't block your door.
        And if it makes more sense to close the door just let me know, and I'll
        understand. I know that you'll take good care of yourself. I love you.

        Hi bub. You BUTT, if you're seeing this you didn't listen to my advice
        and checked the website. I haven't processed everything yet but I
        figured I'd write this just in case you checked. I've spent all day
        today after our call distracting myself. I just didn't feel like I'd be
        able to handle the feelings if I let them well up.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But then, just now, as I finished the game I was using to distract
        myself, I suddenly said out loud, "Is she dead?! No?! Then there's still
        hope". I wrote in my journal, "the fight's not over until she closes the
        door. And I know I'm strong enough to keep fighting". You are my buddy,
        and I love you dearly. We both know you shouldn't wait for me, but if
        it's healthy for you to leave the door just slightly open, I'll fight
        with all the hope I have in me.
