      <br />

      <div class="body">
        These are all my journal entries about my progress for you to read! The
        oldest entry is at the bottom so you can start there.
      </div>

      <div class="bold">August 30, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Oh my gosh I loved your last letter. You know when I got it I
        had to first scroll to the bottom just to check if it was about to be a
        good or bad letter. And then could you believe I scrolled back up just
        to find out you were out there chasing sheep!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I laughed so hard and messaged basically all my friends about it. I've
        been so stressed recently, and part of it is because I know how long I'm
        taking. I want to move faster, but it's taking time, and I'm pushing
        myself, but it's not as fast as I'd like. And in the midst of all this
        anxiety, I get a video of you chasing sheep!! It was the laugh I needed.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I wish you could've heard how vocal I was reading your letter. The loud
        "mmMMMMMmmmm" sound I made when you changed your perspective from having
        to do things to wanting to do them. Or when you said I wouldn't have
        scheduled so many apartment viewings and I yelled, "I could've done it
        too!!".
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm so proud of you for signing a lease!! That's huge! I've always
        wanted you to have a space for yourself, and I'm so glad that you
        finally have it. I laughed a little at you only looking at 7 apartments,
        but I know it's hard to let go of that perfectionism.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Do you remember how I spiraled too when I first moved into my current
        apartment? I remember calling you on the phone, and you encouraging me,
        reassuring me that I'll be able to make the place my own. I remember how
        hard it was to get out of that spiral, and I'm proud of you for being
        able to support yourself through that. And of course, I smiled when you
        got that lamp. When you finished making your space and said you were
        happy, it made me so happy too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also loved your realization about gratitude. A long time ago when I
        didn't understand happiness, that was one of the recurring topics I
        would read about. People would say that feeling grateful was tied
        closely to the kind of happiness that fulfills you long term, the kind
        that we should all be looking for. I forget about that sometimes, but
        it's funny how you've once again ended up with the same answer with your
        intuition again.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also wrote in my notes, "I love that in her gratefulness in seeing the
        beauty around her, she just wants to bring the people she cares about
        there too". It really is just another reason I love the way you are.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        By the way, I don't know if you noticed but when I first opened the
        document you were still editing it! I saw you were in it and I was like,
        "Ahh!! We're not supposed to talk!! Rules!!", so I closed the tab and
        distracted myself instead. I did think about it afterwards and realized,
        oh there aren't any rules against that. But I hope you know I wasn't
        avoiding you for negative reasons, y'know!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I miss you too bub. I have lots that I want to talk about still but I
        wanted to write this letter first to respond to your journal. The
        stressful stuff I don't know if it makes sense to talk about yet, but
        just know that I'm still trying and I think I'm making real progress.
        I'll try to write about the progress next entry soon!! I love you lots,
        bub, and I'm proud of the ways you're growing even now.
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="bold">August 18, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub, jeez it's been a while again. Life has been so stressful, but
        I'm managing the best that I can. I just didn't want you to think that
        I'd forgotten, because I haven't.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I still think about you. The other day I bought a milk frother to heat
        up my milk, and guess what! I found out I could put milk, water, and
        matcha powder all in the machine and it makes the most perfect cup of
        matcha every time. A part of me smiled and thought, if only I had bought
        this sooner.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another day I found out that a Hong Kong cafe restaurant opened within
        delivery distance. They even had macaroni soup and milk tea. I tried it
        and as far as I could tell it tasted good. But it made me sad, so I
        probably won't order it often. I wondered if you would've approved of
        their taste.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I trust and know that you're taking good care of yourself. Recently I
        wrote in my journal that I was so upset at myself. I had burned myself
        out and left no space for me. Even now, I'm scrambling a bit. But I'm
        going to do my best, recover, and forge ahead. I love you dearly, bub.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">July 29, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi again bub, it's been a while huh! I haven't made much progress
        because life has been such a drain lately, and I'm tired a lot. Maybe
        one day we'll get to talk about it in detail. But for now I wanted to
        write a short entry so you know I haven't forgotten!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did end up figuring out a good set of core values, and I feel pretty
        good about them as a reflection of me. Figuring out what a day in my
        ideal life looked like was also nice. In a lot of ways it was
        encouraging to see that a day like that felt very possible with the life
        we had together.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The ideal relationship part gave me a bit more trouble. I think the
        ideal day gave a lot of clues at what the ideal relationship would look
        like, but there are just a few more things that I still haven't figured
        out, but I'll keep trying my best.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Other than that, I went to visit my brother again to help with their
        furniture. I gave them all the updates, and at one point they turned to
        my niece and asked her what she thought I should do. It was almost like
        fortune telling, since we're not sure she really even understands what
        she's being asked about. But, she did think I should get on the plane.
        So at least I have her approval.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I've also been thinking about the notes you shared, where you said that
        you didn't feel like dating me or anybody else right now. I think about
        that pretty often these days. I really do hope that you are recovering
        from your burnout slowly. I love you very much, I hope you're taking
        good care of yourself, and I hope that tiredness would hang onto you
        just a little less.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">July 14, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub! Ok so I read your new therapy notes and have lots of thoughts,
        but I'm going to start writing from before I read that ok!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        First thing's first, my test came back negative so they didn't find the
        bacteria! But it's been wrong before and I'm still getting lots of acid,
        so I'm going to wait another few months to see what happens. Not the
        best, but not the worst!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The next thing is that my friend made me watch a show called Orb. I
        loved it so much that I wanted to say I hope you don't watch it. If we
        somehow make it to the other side of this in the future, maybe we could
        watch it together.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The show came exactly when I needed it. The story had a lot to do with
        the convictions of people. So even when the characters were afraid, even
        when they couldn't possibly know the future, they could find the courage
        to move forward because of their conviction.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And it hit me. Certainty is knowing, but conviction is believing. Each
        of those people moved with such purpose. But it wasn't because they knew
        with certainty what would happen, it was because they had strong beliefs
        and values, and that made them firm in their choices.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I was visiting my brother recently and I was telling him about our break
        up. We went back and forth a bunch, and I told him about my fears. He
        started saying something like, "but you're not being rational! Those
        fears have nothing to do with what choice you should make". I got all
        huffy, like, "ugh!! You're just like Sarah! You're following this
        straight line from intuition or logic to a conclusion, but you're not
        understanding the feelings of the weak! The fear that makes decisions
        difficult!".
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And a second realization hit me. The way he lives, the way you live, the
        way all those characters I love and admire live, are all the same. When
        you have a strong sense of values and beliefs, all decisions boil down
        to "does this align with my values and beliefs". If it does you do it,
        and if it doesn't you don't. As afraid as you get, as difficult as
        things are, it all comes back to alignment, and that cuts through all
        the complexities of fears and anticipations of what might happen.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I told my brother I think that's what's different about me. I can't
        trust my gut or my intuition. I'm critical of everything, even myself,
        and I'm anxious about everything. But looking at you guys, with your
        strong sense of internal values, it's almost like you have a torch
        lighting your way while I'm grasping in the dark.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        So I'm working on defining my core values, ideal life, and ideal
        relationship like you talked about before. I think if I can define them
        in a way that I know is true to me, I'll have something to believe in,
        and I hope that'll give me the clarity I need to make the choices that
        are right for me. I don't know yet if this will work out, but I hope so.
      </div>

      <div class="body">---</div>

      <div class="body">
        Now on to your therapy notes. I got huffy reading your therapist's
        words! Humph!! I mean of course she's right, but again I feel like it's
        delayed compared to my current situation. I'm not only doing external
        experiments anymore y'know!! But of course it's fair that she doesn't
        know that. And I do still think physical attraction can still be real
        thing, which she might disagree with, but I'm struggling through that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did also notice from the previous notes that she sounded frustrated.
        Just the way that she talks about how the experiments might never end. I
        thought that I understood where she was coming from, but I didn't fully
        realize until this time why she might be this frustrated.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm sad to admit that I didn't see earlier how unhealthy this was for
        you, and I'm sorry I put you through that bub. It hurt to see her talk
        about how unhealthy it got, but I know it must be true.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Of course I knew it on some level beforehand, but I think because we
        weren't talking face-to-face, I didn't know it as deeply as I would've
        if you were next to me. When you compared it to the exhaustion you felt
        from your last job, it clicked into place for me just how tired you must
        be. I could feel how you were back then, and I could only imagine how
        you must feel now.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I don't know what's best here. Have you guys talked about what would
        help you recover most? Do these entries get in the way? I can't tell. I
        was happy when I saw that you had been reading these, but I was also
        scared that it wouldn't be healthy. Because if your recovery comes from
        prioritizing yourself, do these get in the way of that? I don't know.
        I'll keep writing these when I have more thoughts, so you'll have the
        option to read them, but I hope you guys talk about what's best for you.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On a lighter note, humph!!! I can't really remember because I have bad
        memory, but I could've sworn I suggested you try doing things without
        research to exposure therapy yourself!!! Maybe!! I might've said that I
        think!! Hmmmmph! But I know, we can only receive these things when we
        are ready for them yada yada. I accept this.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And about those game screenshots. Gosh. I showed my therapist the
        section that you guys said I should share, but I had to clarify that it
        sounds so CHEESY I can barely stomach having written it. She asked,
        "well what's wrong with it?", and I said, "it makes me sound like a
        toxic person!! Like somebody saying ooh woe is me I didn't get enough
        love now I'm sooo broken". Humph!! I never said those things I don't
        know what you mean. 😤 But of course my therapist validated that it's my
        truth so it's fine. And of course I'm not using it as an excuse without
        working on it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I think this is getting a bit too long. As always, I love you
        very much. I hope you get to recover at your own pace. I hope your
        family, friends, and your travels, lighten the load of your exhaustion
        even a little. I hope life is kind to you. I hope you prioritize
        yourself. I'll work hard on finding my own version of the torch in the
        dark, so I can live with the courage and conviction that you live your
        life with. I love and admire you.

      <div class="bold">July 11, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Hi bub, I wanted to write a super short entry just because I didn't want
        the most recent entry to be so gloomy. I haven't gotten the results of
        my acid test back yet, but I'm doing okay and I should get them
        tomorrow.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I've been working through a lot of thoughts, but I haven't figured them
        all out yet. I just wanted you to know that I'm okay, and that I'm still
        trying my best. I also want to write another longer entry soon because
        today is the day we originally scheduled our call for, but I'm still in
        the middle of all my thoughts.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But as always, I hope you're doing well and taking care of yourself, and
        I love you very much.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
      </div>

      <div class="bold">July 1, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        I really hope you've read some of these by now, because I can't keep
        starting every entry by telling you to scroll to the bottom, but then I
        thought I can put it at the top of the page! So that's that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Sadly I haven't made too much more progress since last time. Life's been
        no fun! My acid's been coming back, so I went to get tested today. A
        third round of antibiotics is going to be no good. Plus I've been
        battling my laundry. It's been a few days of going back and forth, but I
        gave up today and rebought almost my entire closet of daily clothes
        because they all got messed up. It's a slight silver lining that all my
        basics are from one store. And I think with acid hurting me for more
        than a year now, I think it's changed how I see food. Just no fun at
        all.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I did have my therapy session, and I'm going to have another one soon to
        try to talk through everything. I told her about how not feeling energy
        in my relationships maybe triggered my fears about certainty. She asked
        me what I'm afraid of happening if I didn't feel that energy. And I knew
        this answer before, but I think I was more aware this time, that I'm
        afraid of my relationship becoming like my parent's.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I know that we've put in so much effort already to make our relationship
        as healthy as we can. At times it feels clear that we won't turn out the
        same way. But another voice in me also says, it's not like my parents
        got into their marriage thinking they'll end up this way — am I so
        arrogant that I think it can't happen to me?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        She also said that sometimes these core beliefs, like mine about ending
        up like my parents, can act like magnets. Every other issue that comes
        up gets pulled in. Every matcha not made, every concern that I have,
        becomes a reason that the core fear might be true.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        These all seem true, but I haven't figured out what to do about it yet.
        I also haven't gotten much further in the book. I've been fighting on
        all fronts just to keep up with life. One of my friends is going through
        a hard time, but they're going to be okay. I'm just a bit tired. But I
        want you to know that I love you very much, and that hasn't changed. If
        my entries come a little slower, it might be the antibiotics. But I will
        keep trying my best. I love you bub. I hope you're doing well.

      <div class="bold">June 24, 2025</div>

      <div class="body">
        Ok so first of all, I still don't know if you'll have seen the previous
        entries so scroll to the bottom if you haven't already, that'll be the
        first entry! Second of all, this beginning part is not really what this
        journal was supposed to be for but I'm writing it anyways.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm feeling so much anxiety!! For a few days now I've felt like my water
        tasted funny, and today I convined myself that it's not just in my head
        so I took apart my filter trying to figure it out. Then I thought my
        filter just needs replacing. But when I went to water my plants in my
        bathtub the water came out brown!! Brown!!! Gross!!!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Then I went outside and there's freaking smoke coming out of the sewers
        on my block. Steam is normal, but the whole block smells like smoke! How
        long has it been doing that! I don't know I don't go outside!! Ugh!! Is
        that why my water's brown!!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I came home after doing a bunch of research on what water to buy and now
        I'm sitting down but I keep saying to myself, "I'm freaking out here!!
        I'm freaking out!!"
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And geez. I just miss my buddy. It's not a big deal, I have water now.
        Maybe I've been poisoning myself but I'm not gonna die. I know that. I
        just miss the support.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Now onto the actual reason I wanted to write this journal. I started
        reading that book you recommended. I considered jumping straight to
        chapter 13, but I figured it would be helpful to read the whole thing so
        that's what I'm doing.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        While reading the book I thought, "oh, maybe Sarah's thought a lot more
        about this breakup than I have". Not because I haven't thought about it
        — I think about it a lot — but I mean that I've been so focused on
        figuring out my own questions, that I don't know if I fully understood
        how you must have felt trying to figure out if you wanted to break up. I
        realized that must have been very painful to go through on your own. I'm
        sorry you had to go through that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also realized that I've been writing these journals from such a place
        of hope, and in reading this book I wonder if your state of mind has
        been very different. I hope these entries haven't been tone-deaf, and if
        they have I hope that you forgive me.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I don't want my holding onto hope to hold you back from moving on. I can
        only write from where I am at right now. I hope you understand.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways the book has been interesting. I plan on reading a little every
        day. Some parts scare me, but some parts make me feel better. I did get
        a good laugh out of when she mentioned a client tried to assign a
        numerical score to each trait so he could add it all up. Sounds like
        someone we know.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'll keep writing these as I figure more out. And know that I'm hoping
        for the best for you, whatever shape that ends up taking. I love you
        very much, bub.

        Hey bub! Wait, first of all I don't know how often you're checking this,
        so if you haven't seen this before you should scroll to the bottom and
        start from there, because the most recent entries are on top. Anyways,
        another day another entry, wow!
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Anyways I thought you should know some recent thoughts I've been
        exploring. I wrote this in my journal.
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        I'm increasingly thinking maybe all my fears about certainty come from
        this kind of helplessness towards the external circumstance of the
        world. Things about my partner or what might happen. I'm giving away
        power. In the view of my confidence in my own power, maybe I'm capable
        of making it work.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I haven't processed it fully yet, but I think the overall idea is that
        maybe I've been living with a kind of learned helplessness in seeing my
        parents fail their marriage, and I'm just barely smart enough to
        recognize the impossibility of certainty, but not smart enough to
        realize that by focusing on these fears I'm giving up my own power to
        direct my life. That maybe I can't fully control my life, but I'm
        discounting how much power I do have to simply choose a path and put in
        effort to make it work.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Like I said, I don't fully know what this means to me yet, but I do feel
        like there's something about thinking this way that makes me less
        scared. Something that allows me to put trust back in myself, instead of
        being scared of being at the mercy of an impossible-to-know future.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I haven't had therapy to process these thoughts yet, but I'll try to
        keep at it. I hope you're doing OK. I also realized recently I don't
        even know how long you're planning on traveling so I have no clue if
        flying out would make sense. But I guess we'll cross that bridge if we
        get there? Anyways, as always, I love you very much and hope that you're
        exploring all the happinesses of traveling that you had planned to.

      <div class="body">
        Look bub! It's a new section of this website. I've been thinking that
        there's lots of things that I want to tell you, but I never feel they're
        fleshed out enough to put in a letter, or they're not romantic enough,
        or meaningful enough. And you'd probably think that you're ok with that,
        but still it's been hard for me to get over that hurdle. So I'm trying
        this as a new way to write things down — it'll be a journal from me that
        you can read, kind of like how you always asked to see my notes.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Now that I've gotten the explanation for this page out of the way, I did
        see the notes you shared today. To be very clear, it was very helpful
        and I'm very glad you shared them. But also I woke up, saw it, and
        thought, "I didn't wake up today to get attacked!! Hello!! Hm!!" 😤
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And I know your therapist is right, but parts of me were like I know all
        of that! I don't know if you guys know, but I'm aware!! Hm!! I have this
        on the top of my notes!!
      </div>

      <div class="quote">
        my uncertainty this whole time maybe wasn't about sarah as a person, or
        even our relationship, because i know exactly who she is, and i know our
        relationship, my uncertainty stems from my fear of not loving her
        enough. me not making matcha, not feeling more energy to express my love
        more, all of them feeds into being afraid, what if i don't love her
        enough?
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        See!! Am not dummy!! But also just so you know I'm not actually mad.
        Just a little huff, but not too seriously.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And to be fair, I recognize that even though I agree that this is likely
        the root issue, I do still feel a need to figure out how much physical
        attraction, or needing medication, or how difficult the past couple
        years were on both of us, affected how I felt. And with me wanting to
        figure all these things out, I recognize the process can take too long.
        I struggle with this thought too.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I feel like it's like how when I wanted to know what love was I had to
        read all those books. When I told my friends recently about us, one of
        them — you can maybe guess which — said he feels like he gets up in the
        morning and he'll choose to play the game of life on medium difficulty,
        but it's almost like I wake up everyday to choose to play on hard
        difficulty. And maybe he's right, but I think sometimes when you're a
        certain kind of person, maybe that's just the kind of life you end up
        with. Of course, I'm thinking about letting go of that need to explore
        all these reasons because I don't want to take too long, but it's been
        hard. I know it must be frustrating to see because progress is so slow,
        but I am trying.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Also on the topic of being slow, I realized there's also probably a
        difference in how long things feel for each of us. I don't know what it
        is, but every partner of mine has said I move slowly, and I've always
        been amazed by how much energy other people have. Even now, two weeks
        after our call, it feels like just yesterday to me, because I've just
        been trying to survive day to day. I do still fully empathize with how
        long things must feel for you, and I know that must be frustrating.
        That's definitely valid, and I'm sorry for that.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        On the topic of how my friends reacted, I got dinner with the two guys.
        They're of course supportive, and they've both individually texted me to
        check up on me, which has been very sweet. One of them is concerned
        about me making any drastic decisions so I think he wants me to be
        thoughtful before doing anything. The other I think is cautious that any
        door that's open isn't open forever, which is also very fair. I told
        them how proud I was of you for making the choice you did, and both of
        them of course understood where you were coming from. I'm glad to have
        them both.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Less important, but the place we went to get dinner was called Phoenix
        Palace. It's run by the same people as Potluck Club! I think you
        would've liked it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I also read the notes you sent about my affirmations for you. Reading
        some of these even I thought, "how was I so sure?!". I realized I've had
        this experience before. My partner will say they stayed because of my
        confidence in working things out, and I'd be surprised that they felt
        that way. I'm not sure why this happens yet, but it does feel related to
        my fears. It feels like I forget my own certainty and it gets painted
        over by my fears, so I end up losing sight of it all. I'll keep thinking
        about it.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Another thought I had while reading it was, I really was surprised by
        how many affirmations I had given. I hope you won't be offended, but I
        had a moment of huffiness and thought, "Hey! I don't know if I even get
        this many affirmations! I want to be princess too you know! Me
        princess!". But of course that's kind of besides our main point here.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The last thing I want to make sure you know for now is, I really hope
        you know that when you asked that question about choosing between you
        and another person, what I was thinking when I gave my answer. I kept
        trying to say, of course if I'm choosing between the people I'd choose
        us, I love us. But if I chose us right now at this moment, I'm scared
        that I might not be choosing myself. I said the choice would be
        difficult because choosing us right now might mean not exploring all
        these things about myself, and that's difficult for me to let go.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I understand how difficult it was hear that I'd have a hard time
        choosing us, and how hard it must be that I'm not there now, but I
        really need you to know that the difficulty is not because I don't love
        us.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I think that's the major points for now. I hope you're doing OK. I hope
        this was an okay replacement for the letters you were expecting. Letting
        you know all my thoughts while I'm going through this, I thought made
        more sense than writing a conclusion to our story in letters and
        affirmations. Because I don't want to write as if I've stopped trying.
        Because I haven't. I hope by doing this that I don't block your door.
        And if it makes more sense to close the door just let me know, and I'll
        understand. I know that you'll take good care of yourself. I love you.

        Hi bub. You BUTT, if you're seeing this you didn't listen to my advice
        and checked the website. I haven't processed everything yet but I
        figured I'd write this just in case you checked. I've spent all day
        today after our call distracting myself. I just didn't feel like I'd be
        able to handle the feelings if I let them well up.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But then, just now, as I finished the game I was using to distract
        myself, I suddenly said out loud, "Is she dead?! No?! Then there's still
        hope". I wrote in my journal, "the fight's not over until she closes the
        door. And I know I'm strong enough to keep fighting". You are my buddy,
        and I love you dearly. We both know you shouldn't wait for me, but if
        it's healthy for you to leave the door just slightly open, I'll fight
        with all the hope I have in me.
