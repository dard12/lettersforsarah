      <div class="body">
        I already told you about this one, but I'll write it out because I know
        you like these thoughts written out in letters. Pretty recently I got
        sad thinking about congee. I was in the gym, and completely out of the
        blue I started thinking about how you started eating congee because of
        me. You had seen that I ate congee with ground turkey and decided that
        you'd try it too. But then you added spinach and quinoa to your congee.
        I saw that and after a while I decided to add quinoa to my congee. And
        again and again we'd trade foods in our routines. You'd start eating
        kiwi, and I'd start eating kiwi. Or it'd be chia seeds. Or
        multivitamins. Or butternut squash. Over and over again this would
        happen.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But I didn't get sad because of the food, of course it's not about the
        food. It's because this is the first time that I've had a partner take a
        serious look at me and decided that they want to live parts of their
        life like mine. You took a part of me, incorporated it, made it your
        own, and influenced me in turn. We traded influences with each other so
        much so that each part is as much me as it is you, so thoroughly mixed
        together that it is neither just me nor you. Our lives hopelessly
        intertwined.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        It's because we respect each other, and because we share values and
        goals, that this was possible. I told you that I saw a Tiktok of
        somebody saying that if you love your partner you wouldn't mind becoming
        more like them. And it's true. It's natural to become more like the
        people you spend time with. But you have to like the person that they
        are, so that you'll appreciate seeing them in yourself.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        The parts of you that I see in me now are the importance that we put on
        our connections with people. I used to get huffy when you'd point that
        out. I'd think, "I didn't just steal those values from you!". But it's
        like the congee. These values were a central part of you. I took a
        serious look at you and decided that I wanted to live parts of my life
        like yours. I could do this because I respect you, and I admire you, and
        these parts of me are some of the parts of myself that I love most now,
        because I love you.
