      <div>Hi! üëã</div>
      <div>Is your name <span class="blue">Sarah</span>?</div>
      <div>(The one that I know?)</div>

      <br />

      <div class="small dark-2">If not then this letter isn't for you.</div>

      <div class="small dark-2">Get out of here! How'd you find this!</div>

      <br />

      <div class="tiny dark-1">You scoundrel! You rascal!</div>

      <div class="tiny dark-1">
        Also this letter might be kind of boring for you.

      <div>
        OK. We good? You're the
        <span class="blue">Sarah-that-I-know</span>?
      </div>

      <br />

      <div>Nice.</div>

      <br />

      <div class="tiny">
        You keep giving me gifts even though we're not supposed to do that!
      </div>

      <br />

      <div class="body">But still, I like them.</div>

      <div class="body">
        The gifts. The things you do. The way you always put thought into them.
        How grateful they always make me feel. How happy.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        You make me want to give you the same happiness. So I thought about how
        much you wanted me to share pictures and videos while I'm traveling, and
        also how much you love words of affirmation.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I used all my available brain cells to put those two thoughts together,
        and made this as a gift.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        Which, by the way, halfway through making this I did think,
        ‚Äú<i>Wait</i>, doesn't she just want you to keep in touch? Aren't you
        actually holding back things you could be sharing to make this gift?‚Äù.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And basically, I didn't have the brain cells left to field those
        questions. So maybe we'll talk about that when I see you. But for now,
        here's some videos from my trip!
      </div>

      <div class="small">Queen's Bath</div>

      <video src="./media/queens-1.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="body">
        People come here to swim in the rip tide pools! We saw people swimming!
        Not in the pool in this video but still, they're super dangerous. One
        guy swam against a wave and moved zero inches because the currents going
        against him were too strong. So we were like, ‚Äú<i>Mmmmmm</i>, no thank
        you. We'll come back at a time with lower tides‚Äù. Also here's me running
        away from a wave.
      </div>

      <video src="./media/queens-2.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="body">
        Not ideal. Anyways we went back another day and the difference was huge.
        Just super calm waters with some waves coming in once in a while. We all
        hopped in for a little bit and swam around. Here's my friend hopping in
        the pool first. You can hear me giggling in the background. Probably
        ignore that.
      </div>

      <video src="./media/queens-3.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="small">Mauna Kea</div>

      <div class="body">
        This mountain is my absolute FAVORITE part of the trip. The idea was
        that we'd drive up this mountain and see the sunset. Seemed normal
        enough. But then as we drove the grass slowly turned into volcanic rock.
        Then the outside started getting covered in mist. There was so much mist
        that water would condense on the car as we drove, but it wasn't raining.
        When the mist left, we realized we had been driving inside of a cloud.
      </div>

      <video src="./media/mauna-1.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="body">
        We got so HYPED. Holy crap. We played every song that had lyrics related
        to getting higher. And we drove higher. Everybody was singing. It was
        the best.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        By the way you can't really hear the other people in this video, but I
        swear it wasn't just me.
      </div>

      <video src="./media/mauna-2.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="body">
        When we got to the top, <i>wow</i>. That could've been a religious
        experience. I mean I'm still not religious, but you know. Also, isn't
        that jeep so cute? The color is nice. Almost like the blue you like,
        except it's not as light.
      </div>

      <video src="./media/mauna-3.mp4" controls></video>

      <div class="body">
        But what I want to say about this memory isn't just how happy I was.
        It's that I kept thinking, over and over, ‚ÄúWow, I wish Sarah was here. I
        wish she could also enjoy this happiness. I wish we could share this
        happiness‚Äù.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        And that's not- that's not very common for me, I think. It's wild
        because that seems like a normal thought that anybody in a relationship
        <i>should have</i>. But I don't usually have that. I don't usually think
        about it. I used to be afraid that maybe I didn't know how to love
        somebody enough to actively wish they could share my happy moments. And
        I'd always felt both guilt about that, and fear about what it meant
        about me as a person.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        But I'm glad that I met you. I see the amount of effort that you put
        into your relationships. The care that you treat people with. That you
        treat me with. The attention you put in to observe our boundaries. The
        courage you have to hold difficult conversations, like when we talked in
        that cabin about feeling emotionally distant, when it was so hard to do.
      </div>

      <div class="body">
        I'm grateful for who you are as a person, because it's because of who
        you are as a person that I'm able to love you so much.
      </div>

      <div class="body dark-2">
        With love, <br />
        Me
